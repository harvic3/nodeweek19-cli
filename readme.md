# The Power Of CLI (NodeJS)

> Presentation for the NodeWeek conference at Globant Medellin CO in August 2019. 

Before we begin we must choose a name for our CLI, and for this particular case I have chosen `"nodewk"`.

# Chapter One ðŸŽ¬

> Basic concepts to create a CLI in NodeJS 

## Let's know to `process.argv`

`process` is an object created when a `script` is running in NodeJS and it contains information about the current process and within its properties we find the `argv` which is an array that contains information about the command that executed the process.

`process.argv` will have at least two data and index one is the path to the NodeJS bin and index two is the path of the script being executed. 

```js
// index.js
'use strict';

const processArgv = process.argv;

console.log('Execution Arguments: ', processArgv);
console.log('I finished');

```

To execute the script we must execute this command in console: 
```console
node index.js
```

When we run the script we'll get this:

```console
$ node index.js
Execution Arguments: [ 'C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe', 'E:\\Repos\\node-cli\\index.js' ]
I finished
```

## Let's make our CLI executable

To do this we have to talk about `Shebang` (`#!`) which is a sequence used on UNIX systems to indicate that a text file is an `executable` and its format is `#!interpreter [optional-arg]`.

So knowing this all we have to do is add at the beginning of our script the line `#!/usr/bin/env node` to tell the system that it is an executable file with the bin of `node`.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
// index.js
'use strict';

const processArgv = process.argv;

console.log('Execution Arguments: ', processArgv);
console.log('I finished');

```

But wait, we're gonna have to do two more things to make this work: 

- First add a branch to our `package.json` file as follows using the `name` we chose for our CLI as shown below:

```json
"bin": {
  "nodewk": "./index.js"
}

```

- Second, we must `link` our application, which will allow us to run our application as if it had been installed directly from `npm` and for that we only have to run:  

```console
npm link
```

And then we execute 

```console
nodewk
```

Then in console we have the following result

```console 
$ nodewk
Execution Arguments: [ 'C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe', 'C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node_modules\\node-cli\\index.js' ]
I finished
```

Then we will be able to see how our application was linked as if it were a npm package since our script is executed from the `node_modules` folder of `nodejs` and this we notice in the index one of the arguments array `argv`.

> Obtain and process user parameters

## Let's get the user parameters 

Imagine that our CLI application `"nodewk"` has some actions among them a `"create"` and that action has input parameters, and then in the console we enter the following:  

```console
$ nodewk create --param1 value1 --param2 value2 --param3 value3 --paramN valueN
```

Then we will modify our script to separate the system parameters from the user parameters and we have the following: 

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
// index.js
'use strict';

const processArgv = process.argv;

if (!processArgv[2]) {
  console.log('No entry');
  process.exit(1);
} else {
  console.log('System params: ', processArgv.splice(0, 2));
  console.log('User params: ', processArgv.splice(2));
}
```
And by executing our command, we will have a result:

```console
$ nodewk create --param1 value1 --param2 value2 --param3 value3 --paramN valueN
System params:  [ 'C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe', 'C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node_modules\\node-cli\\index.js' ]
User params:  [ 'create', '--param1', 'value1', '--param2', 'value2', '--param3', 'value3', '--paramN', 'valueN' ]
```
And as you can see we already have the user parameters.
